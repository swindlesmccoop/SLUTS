# - usage: swallow [prog]
# - unmap current X window and restore it after background process returns
# - i don't recommend using this for programs that draw no window because you
#   will lose your terminal unless you pkill -9, I know mpv does this when
#   playing audio.
# - requires xdotool, baskerville/xdo has a tendency to silently fail when
#   issuing window commands in rapid succession
