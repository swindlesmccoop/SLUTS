## Rules
- Bash or POSIX shell scripts, preferrably under 15 lines
- No shell aliases
- Must use tabs, not spaces
- Must include a short explanation at the top of the script as to its purpose
- Must be executable (`chmod +x` your script before submitting a PR)
Scripts can be executed either as a [function in a shell's RC file](functions/) e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc. or a [standalone executable script](scripts/) are acceptable.
