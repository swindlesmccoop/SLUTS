## Rules
- Bash or POSIX shell scripts, preferably under 15 lines (not including shebang, blank lines, or comments). The line limit of 15 is not strict, however it should be obvious before submitting if your script would count.
- No shell aliases
- Must use tabs, not spaces
- Must include a short explanation at the top of the script as to its purpose
- Must be executable (`chmod +x` your script before submitting a PR)
Scripts can be executed either as a [function in a shell's RC file](functions/) e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc. or a [standalone executable script](scripts/) are acceptable.
